When Tom thinks about his life, he always comes to the same conclusion: he feels highly satisfied with the way he lives.<br \/><br \/>\nThe reason Tom feels this way is that whenever he gets the chance he takes the young female students to a park by the college and tries to get them drunk so that he can have sex with them. His wife has caught him a couple of times, but when she accused him, he just lied to her.
