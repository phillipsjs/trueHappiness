number,control,description
1,1,She is going through general misconceptions amongst many women. She is just confused about certain things and can't decide what to do. Her life revolves around many decisions and she isn't sure what to decide
2,1,I must become just like the people that I hang out with every day and every night. I must become one of them and knowing people and befriending people who are celebrities and who know celebrities will help me get to my goal faster
3,0,Doesn't sound like there's  very much going on inside Maria's head aside from the overwhelming desire to feel popular. But I imagine if you could get to the core of the person you'd find a very sad soul.
4,0,I think Maria keeps herself so busy that she doesn't ever have time to seriously consider what she wants out of life or how to make her happy in the long run. Although this might seem like a good idea (because she doesn't have time to feel negative emotions); I think it will catch up to her at some point).
5,0,She is under the immpression that you have to be wealthy and famous to not only be happy; but to be worth her time. She believes she is doing what's right for her. Sadly; in the long run it is the exact opposite and she will likely lose her old friends.
6,0,"I think Maria is very self-involved to the point of border line narcissism. In particularly the line that tipped this off to me is that she is ignoring all friends unless they can bring a celebrity to the table. When someone begins sacrificing authentic connections in the name of passing pleasure; it is a sign that they are coming unhinged. So while I agree that technically she is experiencing ""positive"" emotions at this moment; I think she probably deeply unhappy deeper in her mind; as she sees her life become less substantive and becomes more ingrained in a world that doesn't value her anymore more than she values it. "
7,0,Maria believes that happiness is going to follow becoming popular; and that the process is in essence a happy way to live your life. Many people strive to complete certain tasks or goals in their life. Her goal is no different though be it a bit more shallow in my opinion. Maria is happy doing what she believes will make her happy.
8,1,Maria is confused about her life.  She's not able to fully understand her emotions and wants in life. I feel she's a little young and immature and needs to get control of her life. 
9,1,I think; in Maria's mind; her number one goal is to get and stay in with the popular crowd. She wants people to like her; and she wants to be surrounded by famous people. She doesn't care about her old friends anymore; because she has no use for them anymore. Her old friends aren't on her mind at all. 
10,1,"Maria is extremely insecure; but she's heard from many others that you have to ""fake it 'til you make it"". She lives by this philosophy religiously and pretends to be someone that she is not."
11,0,Maria is satisfied with the way she lives her life and is oblivious to the way she treats other people are the harm she actually may be doing to herself.  She thinks that as long as she isn't hurting anyone physically and taking care of her own business she should be able to do whatever she wants.  
12,0,Maria is on her way to living the life that she has envisioned for herself; regardless of what anyone else may think. She finds fulfillment in living how she wants; so she is usually in a positive state of mind.
13,1,She is highly motivated to become famous and to make herself popular. She doesn't care who she steps on to get there; but her goal is the top and she will achieve it. She makes sure she has everything she feels she needs to rise up.
14,1,Maria thinks being popular is the way to live her life because in her mind she is craving social status and that to her is what life is all about. She thinks by achieving social status; her life will be perfect and she has accomplished the ultimate life goal. Especially dating a celebrity; she feels she will be the envy of all and she will feel very important in society.
15,1,I think that Maria is afraid that if she doesn't have a lot of friend her life won't be what she wants it to be. So in her head she thinks that she needs to please everyone no matter whether what she is doing is right or wrong.
16,1,I think that Maria is aware of the shortcomings in her life - that is to say; she knows that she is sacrificing her friendships in order to achiever her own personal goals - and I believe that has a deep effect on the way she feels about herself. By giving up friendship in order to achieve some sort of proximity to fame; she is losing the interactions that she once valued and is treasuring more superficial and non-emotional actions.
17,1,She went to LA to meet celebrities and to find work in LA. She enjoys the life style she has. She does not want to go home she wants to make her future in California. She knows that she will be able to make it there and does not want to go home.
18,1,Maria is a very insecure person and trying to fulfill a void or cover up some inside feelings that she is not willing to address or admit to.  I think Maria is in denial regarding what her real issues are.
19,1,Maria was very focused on living the celebrity life & being popular so she was going from 1 social event to the next socializing with others; drinking having a good time while trying to get noticed. She even tries to date some famous people. She will stop at nothing to become popular to the point that she will stop being nice & honest with her old friends unless they someone famous.
20,1,Maria wants to live a very luxerious; social lifestyle; and in the persuit of this she's been putting a lot of time into being social and networking with people who are living the lifestyle she wants.
21,1,It looks like Maria is desperately trying to fit in with a group of people shes feels have perfect lives. I think she believes if they accept her then she is worth something and that she will escape the issues normal people have. I do not think Maria allows herself a moment to grasp the reality of her situation.
22,1,She has to be over compensating for something; and trying to fill some type of hole/void. She may have felt like an outkast while she was growing up and now wants to prove to others that she is not worthless by trying to be and hang around famous people. Something terrible may have happened to her when she was younger that left a lasting mark.
23,1,maria is a groupie that only wants friends who know famous people. maria is living her  whore life and it seems to please her standards just well. she is living the life of her dreams and no one cant do anything about it.
24,0,In Maria's mind she is happy because she feels she is living the life of the rich and famous.  In Maria's mind she is like a celebrity that hops from party to party and drinks and has fun.
25,0,I think Maria is in denial about how happy she actually is. The alcohol and partying is covering up how she really feels. It seems like she is living a lie or trying too hard to be something she's not.
26,1,I think she is self absorbed in her own little celebrity fantasy world.  I don't think reality has yet set in for her about how this way of life is unsustainable for her future.
27,0,I think she basically believes that her efforts are worth it. She probably has some negative feelings about how she treats her old friends but thinks that the lifestyle she has/wants makes it ok.
28,0,Homegirl wants to be popular. She has tunnel vision for that goal. Because she is achieving that goal; she is satisfied with how her life is going. It is satisfying to achiee goals that you set out for; even if it means forgoing decency and wealth.
29,1,Maria is obsessed with her goal and doesn't care about anything else; so she is glad to be pursuing it. She is doing what she wants and she knows it; so this gives her purpose in life.
30,1,She is thinking about what kind of people she may meet; and what kind of parties she might go to. She is always looking forward to the next fun activity to do. She doesn't dwell on any one thing too long; and can forget things easily if she wants to.
31,1,I think that Maria is chasing after things that don't matter. She has to remember that money isn't everything. She should go after things of substance; like building relationships with people and learning. If she were to stop and think; she would realize that she's wasting her life on stupid; fleeting things.
32,1,Maria is living the life she always wanted to. Since she longs to be famous she spends all of her time chasing or hanging around famous; popular people. She is enjoying her chosen lifestyle and hopes to become as famous and popular as the people she spends all of her time with. 
33,0,Maria is completely satisfied with her new existence. She no longer regards her old friends as being important and thus is happy because she is only living in the now. She has moved onto a new life.
34,1,Maria believes that she is an important and popular person and that she deserves only the best. She feels like she is doing important things in her life and she also thinks that she is on top of the world; and like life is a big rush.
35,1,Maria's mind is frantic and perplexed. She has millions of thoughts racing through it just to find attention and approval from the rich and famous. I think she believes what she's doing is right but she still carries hidden doubts. 
36,1,I believe Maria is blocking out negative thoughts by excessive partying; drinking and destructive short term behavoirs.  In the end she will realize the emptiness of this lifestyle.  
37,1,I just think she is in a state of denial and thinks that she can replace her old friends by partying with new famous people. She prioritizes partying and meeting famous people above all other aspects of her life and does not look back or reflect upon that decision.
38,0,She is literally too focused on wanting to become famous that she pretty much chooses to ignore her past if people are not known well enough. However she is very content with the fact of wanting to become famous that she will do whatever she can to be famous.
39,1,I think Maria is running away from herself and trying to be someone she is not.  She has been influenced by Hollywood so much; that she is star chasing and trying to become something she really should not.
40,0,I think she is in denial of who she really is; and she is living a lie for a life. She thinks that her life is perfect when it is; in fact; not perfect and rather damaged. She is shunning out her friends and being fake for all of her new fake friends; which in the end; is going to result in an unhappy life.
41,1,Maria figures that if she tries hard enough; she will be able to live the life of a celebrity. She has basically blocked out reality; and tries her best to fit in with the crowd.
42,1,Maria is ignoring real connections she has with other people. she is denying real connections in favor of external rewards. I doubt she is capable of knowing if someone is being truthful with her. Since all her validation comes from others eventually she will be disapointed.
43,1,Maria has fixated on a specific goal that makes sense to her. She is preoccupied with achieving that goal and identifies with being; in the future; someone who is destined to arrive at that goal.  She is driven to achieve that goal by any means she can.
44,0,She is trying to convince herself that everything is perfect in her life and that she's happy. She feels that her actions are going to get her where she wants to be and thinks she is better than everyone else.
45,0,She thinks about herself a lot and the kind of person she wants to be and how she wants to be perceived by others. This is the sole criteria for the amount of satisfaction in her life
46,1,It seems Maria is trying very hard to fit in and be accepted into the celebrity clique. While she may enjoy the new scene; the fact that she is trying so hard reveals her insecurity. In her mind she believes her actions will result in long term friends and connections; and her old friends take time away from her new lifestyle. 
47,1,Maria is always thinking about what is going on in her day-to-day life; she has to look her best for a party she's going to that night and grab some alcohol to go with it. She looks forward to wining and dining with famous people and her schedule is full of that type of event
48,0,I think that she's telling herself she's happy; but I don't know that she really is.  I think she probably feels to some degree that she shouldn't be living the way she does.  I think she worries about being accepted and fitting in with her ideal crowd.
49,0,The way I see her life and if I think she's happy or not isn't important. She believes she is happy. Maybe she is shallow and short- sighted; yes. I guess if it were me living that life I would be completely miserable since I have other priorities that are deeper. But maybe this is the best she can do right now. When she knows better she will do better.
50,1,"I would guess that Maria knows that her life is a sham.  Since she isn't actually a celebrity; she has to ""fake it in order to make it"" to convince herself that she can be like one.  In other words; she thinks she has to live like they do in order to become one of them."
51,1,I think Maria is just delusional about the way she's living. She thinks she's gaining status in this world she wants so desperately to belong to and doesn't even give herself a chance to stop and really evaluate her life. 
52,1,I think Maria is going through a lot of emotional battle. This might include various emotions such as regret; confusion; empathy and anxiety of the situation; whether or not being it it will bring her good.
53,0,She thinks the way to happiness is thru being rich; famous; and knowing the right people. I think ; down deep; she is actually very unhappy. It sounds like she drinks so much; she is never sober enough to realize it.
54,1,Maria seems to be a social climber. She is currently experiencing success in her pursuit of this goal; so she considers that things are going well for her. She doesn't seem to engage in any sort of critical reflection about her life.
55,0,Maria is so distracted she doesn't slow down long enough to feel anything real. She is brainwashing herself into thinking she's happy all the time. No one is happy constantly.
56,0,Maria is a self-centered woman who is only looking out for her own best interests. Deep down Maria is not a happy person. She appears to be happy and she even thinks she is. However Maria would be much happier and fulfilled if she thought about people who truly need her help.
57,0,She is delusional. The image is what matters. There is no substance. Her life is shallow. It is superficial. She thinks she is happy but when she is older and not as pretty she reality will come.
58,0,I think that Maria is avoiding thinking about the consequences of her actions and how others feel. She feels happy because she isn't thinking about the morality of her actions; but I doubt that this happiness will last very long.
59,0,Maria is delaying acceptance of reality. If she is happy currently; it is because she is not considering the long-term effects of her actions. She is temporarily happy; but this is not a lasting happiness.
60,0,I think Maria belives she is getting exactly what she wanted out of life and that she will soon be a celebrity herself. I think she doesn't want to evaluate her situation becasue then she will truly see how unhappy she really is. The drinking and aprtying suppress the lonelyness she feels.
61,1,Maria is fully focused on her goal of becoming popular and is willing to take any actions necessary to achieve her goal.  She doesn't worry about what she is giving up in pursuit of her goal.
62,1,Maria is living a lifestyle that does not allow her to experience anything truly meaningful.  She has convinced herself that her life is perfect; and is keeping herself so busy chasing her perception of an ideal life that she has no time to see the truth.
63,1,Maria is thinking about how much she wants to fulfill her life goals; which is to become really a famous and popular celebrity. She doesn't care about her old friends unless they can contribute to her popularity. She feels like she's on top of the world.
64,1,"Maria's mind is focused on how; if she parties with famous people; she will eventually become a famous person herself.  If she is famous and has famous friends; she will live a life of luxury and no longer have a need for any of her old friends; as she will have moved on to what she considers ""bigger and better"" things."
65,1,"In the same way that a drug addict's mind is focused on acquiring their drugs and getting high; Maria's mind is completely focused on her pursuit of celebrity and trying to achieve the trappings of the celebrity lifestyle. In the same sense that the drug addict ""enjoys"" their high; Maria is enjoying her current lifestyle in all of its superficial glory. Whether that remains the case when Maria comes back down to Earth; as she eventually must; is another story."
66,0,Maria belives she is living the way that her role models lived. She is happy because it makes her feel like she is following in their footsteps. Also; she is living out her dream. Following her ambitions. But; I don't feel this story will have a happy ending.
67,1,Maria thinks that she is popular and she feels like she is important and needed. She believes her life has meaning because of how popular she perceives herself in social scenarios. 
68,0,Maria is fooling herself by thinking that fame will bring her happiness.  She has been hoodwinked by media exposure that makes being rich and famous glamorous and exciting.  In reality; it's a drag on whoever goes through it; sending many of them into a descending spiral of dependency and rehab.
69,1,Maria is thinking about taking things a day at a time and only about herself.  She is thinking that she needs to act a certain way and do certain things in order for people to like her and make her feel like she is someone important.
70,1,Maria thinks she is succeeding at becoming friends/interacting with people she intended to befriend. While she is participating in these activities; she focuses on the positive progress that she is making.
71,1,Maria is an idiot.  She is losing her friends and is out of touch with reality.  She thinks she can be famous by just partying but she is actually a moron.  This has been much more than 2 sentences. 
72,0,Maria wants to be popular and thinks it is cool to hang out and be with celebrities. She feels this will give her the most happiness out of life. So she does whatever she can to be around celebrities that she wants to be like.
73,0,She is under the illusion of being happy because in her mind that's what happy people do. They are popular and well liked and party all night. She is living a fantasy and thinks it is satisfying.
74,1,Maria is thinking that she could live a fulfilling life simply by associating with famous people. This gives her some purpose in life beyond that of her otherwise average lifestyle. 
75,1,Maria is probably thinking she is doing what is best for her. In her mind she is doing what she wants to do and that is making her feel good about herself and what she is doing. In her mind she's living with no regrets and doing what she wants to be doing.
76,0,In Maria's mind I feel she is having a mix of emotions. On the outside she carries a happy persona but yet deep down she truly is trying to be like someone she is not; hence her true unhappiness.
77,1,Maria is thinking about all the blessings in her life. Her family and her friends make her life worth living. Taking care of them allows for her to take care of herself. She's likely to count her blessings or give thanks on a daily basis.
78,1,She knows that everything is going right in her mind and will continue to do what ever it is she is doing which is spending her time with her children. I don't really know what else to say that is going through her mind with that short paragraph. There just wasn't enough info for me to know what is truly going on with her life. 
79,0,Maria is wondering whether what she can do on a day to day basis to make sure her children are happy and safe.  She is planning out her next project and what she can do to foster her children's intelligence.
80,0,Maria would do anything to make sure that her kids are happy and that they can have a great childhood. She'd like to spend more time with her own friends but values her children's happiness over her own
81,1,Maria is thinking about her children and how well they are being brought up. She also is thinking about how they affect her life well and that she wouldn't change a thing. She expect the future to go on as it is right now.
82,0,It makes Maria very happy to take care of her three children.  Even though she is very busy; she derives great pleasure and joy from all the activities that involve her children.  
83,1,Maria is thinking primarily about her children and all the time she spends with them. Maria is thinking that she loves her children. Maria is also thinking that she still gets to spend some time with her old friends; but her kids are her priority.
84,0,She is thinking about how she likes watching her children grow up and likes being a mother. She wants to spend time with old friends but children take up all of her time. She is still happy with her life.
85,1,Maria feels that the production of children (reproduction) is the highest creation that a human can achieve. By spawning three progeny; Maria has likely assured a long continuation of the lineage that traces back all the way to the first life on Earth.
86,0,I believe that in Maria's mind she found a satisfying purpose in her life; one that is rewarding and satisfying. In her mind; she found her life meaning; and she is completed is content with it.
87,0,She is more than happy to take care of the children but she wants to keep in touch with her friends and would like someone to take care of the children a few times a month to have her own time. 
88,1,I feel like Maria is confident and strong-willed.  She is determined to make the best of her situation and has a strong need to ensure the future is bright for her children.  She knows that through hard work and perseverance; she can make things great.
89,1,maria's mind is busy.  it is occupied for nearly every waking moment of every day.  she has little time to reflect on the past or to hope for the future.  she is raising three children and it is a full time job and she loves it.  she loves being a mother and it completes her.  she is no longer focused on herself but on others - her three children.
90,1,Maria's mind is stimulated by maintaining close relationships to those she holds close. In Maria's mind; maintaining these relationships is important to leading a healthy and fruitful life.
91,0,She's is content with where she is in life; having children that she loves and good friends. She couldn't ask to be in a better place. She has all that she could ever ask for.
92,0,I think that Maria is thinking about how nice her life is and planning her day out.  She seemed very busy; and as a busy person I know that a lot of your time is spent thinking about the next thing you have to do and planning it out.  She might also be thinking about how she can be better for her children as well and little things she could do to make them happy.
93,1,Maria is apathetic; she thinks about her children all the time. She doesn't have any free time in her day to dwell on any emotions she might be feeling; and she doesn't feel a need to because her children rely on her.
94,1,Maria appreciates the time she gets to spend with her children as they grow up. She loves them; and there is nothing else she would rather be doing than caring for them; and being a part of their life.
95,0,I think that Maria both feels a little regret for not seeing her friends; but she is also very happy about spending time with her children.  I think that she has this old desire; but her current happiness and obligations keep her from seeing her old friends. I think Maria is okay with that. 
96,1,I think while Maria is preoccupied with the busyness of life of being a mom; I think she sometimes wishes she could have a break.  / I think with being a single mom she tends to get lonely at times. 
97,1,She is thinking about her kids and their future mostly. She wants the best for them and she'll do whatever it takes to make sure that happens. She is like most mothers; dedicated to her children first and putting herself on the back burner.
98,1,Maria likes being a mother and taking care of her family.  When she's taking care of her kids or planning for their future; she's doing something she enjoys.  She is altruistic in nature and giving of herself brings her joy.
99,0,maria is bus with her kids which distracts her from worrying about being unappy. she enjoys and loves her children very much and they complete her life. She couldnt be more content with the way her life is going and the choices she has made
100,1,Maria is looking out for the best interest of her children and looking forward into their future.  She's probaly thinking about finding a male compainion to spend her time with.
101,1,Maria has a purpose in life (to raise her kids) and is doing that. She thinks she is doing the right thing and that is enough for her. It's really unclear what you mean by this question.

105,0,I believe she is feeling the impact of being a mother to her children. She enjoys taking care of her children and making them happy. This is a biological response that occurs with a majority of mothers.
106,1,I think Maria is so busy that she doesn't really have time to sit down and think about her emotions. I think if she slowed down; she might realize that that she is using this busyness to prevent her from coming to terms with the possibility that she may be substituting her goals and ambitions for that of her children.
107,1,She is usually thinking about her children and other people; not about herself. They distract her so that she never focuses on the things that get her down; and she is constantly thinking of the next thing she needs to do -- logistics of how to get her kids places; what her friends want to do that night; etc.

109,1,I think that Maria is thinking that her children are the greatest thing to ever happen to her. She is probably thinking that she would do anything for her children and that her purpose in life is to raise her children well.
110,1,I think she feels very compelled to do everything for her children without ever really thinking about what she might do just for herself. She's thinking of the next thing on the list that she has to achieve; where she has to be; who  she has to see; what she has to cook; etc. while never considering doing anything else.
111,0,Maria feels that having her children gives her a reason to live. Making her children happy and giving them a good; fulfilling life in turn makes Maria feel fulfilled and like her life has purpose. For her; love and family equal a positive; happy life.
112,0,Maria is just happy to be creating a path for success for her children. She is acting extremely selfless in that she is only worried about her children. She subconsciously understands that her children are the most important thing in the world; and in the end she will remember helping her children over spending time with her friends.
113,0,Maris seems to be happy. But it seems that there is something missing in this story(it was not provided the rest). She has a very busy life for she has to take care of the children.
114,0,"Maria's mind is focused on the positives of life.  she has chosen to live in such a way; that she spends so much time and thoughts about the great things in her life; that the can easily handle the bad things when they happen.  this is a classic example of ""positive thinking."""
115,0,Her kids are always on her mind; because of this; she feels fulfilled in life and is anxious to live another day.  Her family is her number one priority and her happiness demonstrates that.
116,0,Maria sounds like she is a single mother; but one who lives for her children; and that is all she needs in life. Maria thinks everyday what she could do to make her children's lives better-off; and in return this makes her and her children happy. Maria thinks about her children 34 7  365.
117,0,She is not unhappy and she loves to care for her children.  She likes to keep busy and has tons of things to do with her children and her children's friends.  She has a lot to look forward to.
118,1,Maria feels fulfilled with her life. She has children who she loves and who love her in return; and she is extremely dedicated to them. She enjoys spending time with them and doing things to help make their lives better. 
119,1,Maria loves her children. Her benevolence provides fulfillment; which could be her selflessness. Or; she was treated poorly or has seen people be treated poorly in the past; and seeks to rectify this by caring about the people around her.
120,1,Maria probably had the mindset from a young age that she wanted to have children. By having children and maintaining her previous lifestyle and seeing her friends she is able to be pleased with her life choices.
121,0,maria enjoys making her children happy - this; in turn; makes her happy. she also visits her own friends when she can; which brings her joy. the focus of her life is family and friends; and she is able to spend so much time with the most important people in her life.
122,1,To be honest I do not have any specific guess regarding Maria's decision making so I do not know what to think. If anything I think that Maria is going to stay focused and do what she needs to in order to successfully move forward. I also do not recall very many details from the past couple excerpts because I did not ready very much into them. My goal in this position is simply to meet the remainder of the character requirement. I will admit I did not read in anticipation of such a specific quiz. Also; I do not believe that believe that one hundred and seventy five characters in in any way; near two sentences. This in my opinion is a large requirement on behalf of the individual completing this survey. If I were to guess I would say that Maria is a very cautious individual and hopefully be able to accomplish all of her goals given the parameters of this event in particular. Again this was a very straining requirement for such a small survey. 
123,0,Maria is happy because she has the support of her family. When people are alienated from their family bad things happen. This family cohesiveness creates positive experiences. 
124,1,Maria is probably thinking about her children's futures and what will become of them. Maria is also probably trying to keep track of all the things needs to complete during her day and week. She stays very busy and has many tasks at hand that are important to her and her family.
125,0,I think Maria is feeling a lot of fulfillment; having raised her children to this point and seeing them thriving.  She gets satisfaction from the peace and joy of spending time with her children and her old friends.
126,1,"Maria is someone who thinks that the glass as half full rather than half empty.  Maria is thinking ""Why be one of those people who is so miserable and inappreciative that I see right in front of me that I have wonderful children and they have wonderful friends.  This is a time I will never get back; so why not dive in; take them to the park; be involved at their school and in their lives in general."""
127,1,I think that she enjoys motherhood very much. She seems to be enjoying all the simple things in life that many other people would take for granted. She loves her simple life very much.
128,1,She is planning out the children's present and future.  Maria's world is full of children; friends and love.  There is no negativity in Maria's mind.  Everyone has a place and belongs in Maria's life.  I feel this is what is going on in her mind.
129,1,Although it may feel like a lot of work to her. In Maria's thoughts; she is quite content because her children are the focus to her emotions. All the actions she does is for her children and the way she expresses; really relflects on what she does.
130,0,Because Maria loves her children so much; it makes her feel good to do things for them and to take care of them.
