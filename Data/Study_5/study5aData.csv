R_5mOMlcHGWfnwfo9		1	1	7	7	7	"Maria is the victim of  low self esteem. On the surface Maria seems carefree. Maria seems to be living a lifestyle of fun and luxury. However, I am quite sure that a person cannot possibly exist living in the style Maria is living for an very long without finding themselves alone and unfulfilled. Maria is wading into a sea of people all trying to accomplish the same goal. All of these people have nothing to offer one another, and all of these people are not being true to themselves. I am sure that Maria believes that she is deeply inadequate as a person and this is her ticket to finding success in life. Maria is not seeing that there is not a short cut in life to fulfillment. I am sure that eventually Maria will be fall short and then quickly realize that she has no real friends to depend on. The fact that Maria can be so single minded on shallow goals is a drastic shame. Maria feels that she does not need her former connections and friends at this time, but she will in time realize the error of her ways."										M_B_P_Hap	instruct|neg_affect|pos_affect|life_satis

I really don't think Maria is actually happy because she doesn't mention doing things that makes Maria happy it's all about her kids.  Also one thing that I failed to pint out the article is kind of written in almost a condesceding tone as it list why shes happy I took it as the opposite."		26	1	1		2	5			M_G_P_Hap	instruct|neg_affect|pos_affect|life_satis

Most people may think she is shallow but she is too self absorbed to agree or understand their point of view. She may also be a person who is generally positive and not susceptible to  being depressed. As she matures her position may change. Any one chasing their dreams can be happy.		43	1	5		4	3			M_B_P_Hap	instruct|pos_affect|life_satis|neg_affect
