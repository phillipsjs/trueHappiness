By the way bitcoins are made by the NSA and will replace USD and other world currencies so start saving.atriapaul@aol.com ",Garrett Immoral & Moral,"In the first situation and second situation the word ?sometimes? changes the meaning. In the first sentence the fact that there is not the word ?sometimes? means he pressured her to talk and pretend like everything is ok. His thrill is not the sex it is the abuse of an innocent being that happens to be his niece since that is what is readily accessible to him with him in control of the situation of the children. He has allowed this or was created with a tendency towards cruelty to become how he thinks, and acts, and views life, even if he is not capable of understanding this consciously. Do not think that predators like these have the same ?feelings? from sex that someone who has sex with another and both are consensual and have a different mindset than this person described in the situation.  /  / ?One of his favorite things is when his niece comes over to play with his kids.? / ?The reason Garrett feels this way is that when his niece comes over to spend the night, Garrett pressures her to have sex with him. After that, they all talk about what they did that day and what they want to be when they grow up. Afterward, Garrett likes to think about what happened that night as he falls asleep.?  / These are the only relevant parts of the situation described for evaluation.  The reasons are that these describe his oppression of the victims. He literally feeds off the negative/low frequency emotions of them like a food source for his sickness. Anything of what would be considered positive by nature would make him have an opposite emotion towards the situation then people who do not view life in the same manner as he does. /  / ?Garrett is a forty-five year old man who lives in the suburbs of Atlanta with his family.? / ?Almost every single day Garrett feels good and generally experiences a lot of pleasant emotions. In fact, it is very rare that he would ever feel negative emotions like sadness or loneliness. When Garrett thinks about his life, he always comes to the same conclusion: he feels highly satisfied with the way he lives.? / These parts do not relate to the situation described. The part of age sounds like the typical once a person turns a certain age all of a sudden someone who is around 18 is not attractive or some excuse told over and over again. Put those people in a situation and watch how all of a sudden an excuse will be made to why this is an exception to the behavior. This type of denial of natural feelings cause people to act the way they do in society with education, politicians, religious and other authority figures. The phrase pleasant emotions in the sense that he feels satisfied with his doing could be correct. Sadness and loneliness does not cause someone to commit an act like this to a child. A child is something that is not as educated in what society thinks is intelligence but understands fully what is right and wrong by emotions and is corrupted into this by him because the child needs to be taught how to develop their emotions not just their read book brain knowledge. Until this is done someone who does not understand this fact will have a hard time understanding what I wrote. This society promotes sex with children through subliminal messages from Disney and news media outlets and the shows that are shown on TV and the list goes on and on so you should be studying your information providers and not just a bunch of people who do not understand control. That is the whole agenda here with the sexing of children. To destroy the human emotion on what is right and wrong in order to maintain control. /  / Situation 2 / He sounds content with how his life has played out and his niece is the example of his family living on up to his standards as he sees it through his niece. This is reaffirmed to him every night when she tells him about what she wants to be when she grows up. He enjoys reading to her because he gets to pick some kind of subliminal message for what would give someone a good emotion of higher frequency. His age once again does not matter nor does his background or living conditions, or race. His feelings of sadness and loneliness are not the same as others since he is in what he regards as his final stage of life and looks to different emotions for satisfaction. This is when a human returns to the state that emotions are important and need to be combined with the brain knowledge everyone is taught to believe and life is reevaluated by them. He sleeps knowing he did his part as he sees it. /  /  / Paul Charles Atria II  / 352-474-1232  / 595-36-4138 /  / ",0,5

While these may both receive the term ""happiness"" (and are surely involve related psychological/biological systems), I still see them as different emotions.

My e-mail address: mikaela.akrenius@gmail.com,Tom Moral & Immoral,"I think that two factors are relevant in determining whether the difference between the two passages is or is not relevant to the question of happiness: a) the definition of happiness, and b) real-life experiences. In the point of view that I chose, ""happiness"" is something deeper than the emotions an individual is experiencing during one day or a brief period of time. Since the story did not determine for how long Tom has been happy and for how long he has been working as a janitor, I used real-life experiences to deduce the ""big picture"". The way I see it, the Tom depicted in the first story is likely to keep his job, to stay happily married, and to gain real satisfaction from the work he is doing for a long period of time, being genuinely happy. On the other hand, the Tom of the second story behaves short-sightedly (problems with girls, alcohol, stealing), suggesting that he has some problematic mental issues that he has not yet faced. Even though he would report feelings of happiness, I would think that his reports are less reliable than those of Tom1, and that even though he (Tom2) would be genuinely happy now, he would not be that in the long run (stealing suggests that he will soon get caught and fired from his work, resulting in unhappiness). I guess that my intuition links genuine happiness with moral behavior that is beneficial for yourself as well as for others in the long run. I don't know whether this intuition is correct: can for instance people with severe psychopathological disorders experience genuine feelings of happiness while showing extremely destructive behavior? Possibly, if the emotions of remorse or negative consequences are not anticipated.

He has allowed this or was created with a tendency towards cruelty to become how he thinks, and acts, and views life, even if he is not capable of understanding this consciously. Do not think that predators like these have the same ?feelings? from sex that someone who has sex with another and both are consensual and have a different mindset than this person described in the situation.  /  / ?One of his favorite things is when his niece comes over to play with his kids.? / ?The reason Garrett feels this way is that when his niece comes over to spend the night, Garrett pressures her to have sex with him. After that, they all talk about what they did that day and what they want to be when they grow up. Afterward, Garrett likes to think about what happened that night as he falls asleep.?  / These are the only relevant parts of the situation described for evaluation.  The reasons are that these describe his oppression of the victims. He literally feeds off the negative/low frequency emotions of them like a food source for his sickness. Anything of what would be considered positive by nature would make him have an opposite emotion towards the situation then people who do not view life in the same manner as he does. /  / ?Garrett is a forty-five year old man who lives in the suburbs of Atlanta with his family.? / ?Almost every single day Garrett feels good and generally experiences a lot of pleasant emotions. In fact, it is very rare that he would ever feel negative emotions like sadness or loneliness. When Garrett thinks about his life, he always comes to the same conclusion: he feels highly satisfied with the way he lives.? / These parts do not relate to the situation described. The part of age sounds like the typical once a person turns a certain age all of a sudden someone who is around 18 is not attractive or some excuse told over and over again. Put those people in a situation and watch how all of a sudden an excuse will be made to why this is an exception to the behavior. This type of denial of natural feelings cause people to act the way they do in society with education, politicians, religious and other authority figures. The phrase pleasant emotions in the sense that he feels satisfied with his doing could be correct. Sadness and loneliness does not cause someone to commit an act like this to a child. A child is something that is not as educated in what society thinks is intelligence but understands fully what is right and wrong by emotions and is corrupted into this by him because the child needs to be taught how to develop their emotions not just their read book brain knowledge. Until this is done someone who does not understand this fact will have a hard time understanding what I wrote. This society promotes sex with children through subliminal messages from Disney and news media outlets and the shows that are shown on TV and the list goes on and on so you should be studying your information providers and not just a bunch of people who do not understand control. That is the whole agenda here with the sexing of children. To destroy the human emotion on what is right and wrong in order to maintain control. /  / Situation 2 / He sounds content with how his life has played out and his niece is the example of his family living on up to his standards as he sees it through his niece. This is reaffirmed to him every night when she tells him about what she wants to be when she grows up. He enjoys reading to her because he gets to pick some kind of subliminal message for what would give someone a good emotion of higher frequency. His age once again does not matter nor does his background or living conditions, or race. His feelings of sadness and loneliness are not the same as others since he is in what he regards as his final stage of life and looks to different emotions for satisfaction. This is when a human returns to the state that emotions are important and need to be combined with the brain knowledge everyone is taught to believe and life is reevaluated by them. He sleeps knowing he did his part as he sees it. /  /  / Paul Charles Atria II  / 352-474-1232  / 595-36-4138 /  / ",,

Please email erik.nook@gmail.com  Fascinating questions - good luck!,Tom Moral & Immoral,"These modifiers (as well as the difference in the first paragraph - ""see his wife"" vs ""meet the young female students"") make huge differences in how the term ""happiness"" is defined.  I think the actual definition of this word is ambiguous in society, and these two framings refer to slightly different emotions, even though people often call both of them ""happiness.""  One is a very meaningful, prosocial and value-based experience of feeling like you are achieving your ideals.  The other is a sensory, self-interested and reward-based feeling of getting things that you want and experiencing pleasure.  While these may both receive the term ""happiness"" (and are surely involve related psychological/biological systems), I still see them as different emotions.  They'd likely receive similar ratings on a ""happiness"" scale, but I'd say that's owing, once again, to ambiguity as to the definition of this term.",,

My e-mail address: mikaela.akrenius@gmail.com,Tom Moral & Immoral,"I think that two factors are relevant in determining whether the difference between the two passages is or is not relevant to the question of happiness: a) the definition of happiness, and b) real-life experiences. In the point of view that I chose, ""happiness"" is something deeper than the emotions an individual is experiencing during one day or a brief period of time. Since the story did not determine for how long Tom has been happy and for how long he has been working as a janitor, I used real-life experiences to deduce the ""big picture"". The way I see it, the Tom depicted in the first story is likely to keep his job, to stay happily married, and to gain real satisfaction from the work he is doing for a long period of time, being genuinely happy. On the other hand, the Tom of the second story behaves short-sightedly (problems with girls, alcohol, stealing), suggesting that he has some problematic mental issues that he has not yet faced. Even though he would report feelings of happiness, I would think that his reports are less reliable than those of Tom1, and that even though he (Tom2) would be genuinely happy now, he would not be that in the long run (stealing suggests that he will soon get caught and fired from his work, resulting in unhappiness). I guess that my intuition links genuine happiness with moral behavior that is beneficial for yourself as well as for others in the long run. I don't know whether this intuition is correct: can for instance people with severe psychopathological disorders experience genuine feelings of happiness while showing extremely destructive behavior? Possibly, if the emotions of remorse or negative consequences are not anticipated. (Hard to tell if you can not measure happiness directly -> the problem of qualias.) /  / Note: Your two passages differed also in the first paragraph (wife vs. female students), which was not underlined.",,

It seems potentially relevant, and the lack of underlining makes it look underhand (in fact, I failed to notice it while answering it, as I assumed the first two paragraphs WERE identical. /  / The question asks if he is happy - this is clearly true (while he may be less happy - or more happy - in one story than the other) the vignette gives little doubt that his mental state is 'happy' rather than 'not happy'.  /  / Happiness in story #2 may represent pathology (an agent with typical contemporary morality would not be ""happy to be Tom"" or ""happy to do what Tom does"", unless there is some reason to believe that about the young female victims are less deserving of their belongings than Tom is of his alcohol...) - but happiness is subjective, and Tom believes he is happy, and feels happy.
