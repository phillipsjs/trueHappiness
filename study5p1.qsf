When Sarah thinks about her life, she always comes to the same conclusion: she feels highly satisfied with the way she is living.<br \/><br \/>\n\tThe reason Sarah feels this way is that she stays incredibly busy all day\u00a0poisoning the many sick children who depend on her for their medication. She often wonders whether she will be able to poison all of them. Every day she carefully measures how much poison she will give each child, and then watches to make sure the child swallows it. Sarah doesn\u2019t really know how many children have been killed by her, but she thinks about it when she falls asleep at night.<\/span><\/p>","DataExportTag":"M_B_P_Hap","QuestionID":"QID675"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_b9hMTbBKuYhwJCJ","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID732","SecondaryAttribute":"Please enter your Mturk ID in the box below","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"Please enter your Mturk ID in the box below","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"trukID","QuestionType":"TE","Selector":"SL","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Please enter your Mturk ID in the box below","Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"MinChar","MinChars":"9"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID732"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_b9hMTbBKuYhwJCJ","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID55","SecondaryAttribute":"Please indicate the highest level of education completed.","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"Please indicate the highest level of education completed.","DataExportTag":"Education","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Please indicate the highest level of education completed.","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Grammar School"},"2":{"Display":"High School or equivalent"},"3":{"Display":"Vocational\/Technical School (2 year)"},"4":{"Display":"Some College"},"5":{"Display":"College Graduate (4 year)"},"6":{"Display":"Master's Degree (MS)"},"7":{"Display":"Doctoral Degree (PhD)"},"8":{"Display":"Professional Degree (MD, JD, etc.)"},"9":{"Display":"Other"}},"ChoiceOrder":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"],"Randomization":{"Type":"None"},"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponseType":"ON"}},"VariableNaming":{"1":"Grammar School","2":"High School or equivalent","3":"Vocational\/Technical School (2 year)","4":"Some College","5":"College Graduate (4 year)","6":"Master's Degree (MS)","7":"Doctoral Degree (PhD)","8":"Professional Degree (MD, JD, etc.)","9":"Other"},"Language":[],"QuestionID":"QID55"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_b9hMTbBKuYhwJCJ","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID662","SecondaryAttribute":"Please tell us whether you agree or disagree with the following statement:\nMaria is happy.\n\u00a0","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Please tell us whether you agree or disagree with the following statement:<\/span>\n<br><br>\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><b>Maria is happy<\/b>.<\/span>\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAHR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText","LabelPosition":"BELOW"},"QuestionDescription":"Please tell us whether you agree or disagree with the following statement:\nMaria is happy.\n\u00a0","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Disagree"},"2":{"Display":"&nbsp;"},"3":{"Display":"&nbsp;"},"4":{"Display":"In between"},"5":{"Display":"&nbsp;"},"6":{"Display":"&nbsp;"},"7":{"Display":"Agree"}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"ChoiceGroups":{"cg_1":{"ChoiceGroupOrder":null,"GroupLabel":"group","Options":[]}},"ChoiceGroupOrder":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,"cg_1"],"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">Sarah is happy.<\/span><\/span>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;<\/div>","QuestionText_Safe":"<span><span>Sarah is happy.<\/span><\/span>\n<div>\n\t\u00a0<\/div>","DataExportTag":"M_G_P_Hap","QuestionID":"QID662"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_b9hMTbBKuYhwJCJ","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID739","SecondaryAttribute":"Please tell us whether you agree or disagree with the following statements about the story you just ","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<span style=\"font-size:19px;\">Please tell us whether you agree or disagree with the following statements about the story you just read.<\/span>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"instruct","QuestionID":"QID739","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Please tell us whether you agree or disagree with the following statements about the story you just read.","ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"Type":"None"}},"GradingData":[],"Language":[]}},{"SurveyID":"SV_b9hMTbBKuYhwJCJ","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID1","SecondaryAttribute":"Research Informed Consent\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tIntuitions on Social Judgments\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tPurpose:\n\n\tWe are conducting","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<p class=\"MsoTitle\" style=\"text-align: center;
